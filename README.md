# OpenLibrary
In this website, anyone can come and upload a book as pdf and contribute to the library's collection of books. Any user can access these books for free.  
For running the site you have to create a database named "pdf".
    - Inside the database, make a table named "booklist" with two columns "ID":(set to auto increment) and "Books"
    - connect your database by making changes in "connect.php" 
    - you are good to go.
